I was sitting on the bench in the park and saw a couple talking, which grabbed my attention as I never had one (will cry later about it). They were talking about how much they love each other, what they can do for each other, and how many likes they get on Instagram when they post about the things they do together on a daily basis — blah, blah, blah…

But for a second, I thought, is this real love? All the time, they talk only about the **external feelings** that make them feel good to be in a relationship, but what about their **own feelings**?

I believe the truth can’t be intellectualized; it can only be experienced.  
Don’t try to use your intellect to figure it out — you won’t. As soon as you intellectualize it, you’ve missed it. The truth does not come from memorizing a sentence or two. A child can do that, but they will not understand the truth.  

**The truth comes in the form of a feeling.**

You don’t need any reason to love someone. When I asked my friend why he loves his girlfriend, he replied with so many things like, “She is cute, caring, calls me all the time,” etc. But my point is — why do you need a reason to love someone? Don’t you think love is a feeling that can never be described in words?

Ask yourself: why do you love your mother?  
Do you love her because she makes tiffin for you, cleans your room, or washes your clothes? No, right? You don’t have any reason for it. Whenever she is around, you feel good; her presence is more than enough to love her.

I might be completely wrong, but I feel all the answers lie deep inside our soul — we just need to **feel** them.  
This is not all about love; this is about everything.

I might be completely wrong and make no sense. If so, let me know your take on this, as you might see a different side of the world that I can’t see right now with my four eyes. After all, I’m only 20 and just starting to understand things.

Thanks for reading.
